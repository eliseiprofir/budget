        - Examples: Cash, ING, Revolut, Savings account, Investment account
        - Each location tracks its own balance

        **Buckets** represent different purposes or categories for your money.
        
        - Examples: Economies, Investments, Necessities, Education, Donation, Fun
        - Each bucket has an **Allocation Percentage** that determines how income is distributed
        - Total allocation percentages across all buckets should equal 100%
        - Buckets help you organize your money by purpose rather than location
        - Every transaction must have a bucket
        
        **Split Income Feature**:
        - When your bucket allocations total 100%, you can use the "Split Income" option for positive transactions.
        - This automatically creates multiple transactions that distribute your income according to your bucket allocation percentages.
        - Example: if you receive 1000 and have buckets set up as Education (30%), Necessities (50%), and Fun (20%), the system will automatically create three separate transactions of 300, 500, and 200 to the respective buckets.
        - Useful for automatically allocating your salary or other regular income.

        **Categories** help classify your transactions by type. Each category has a **Sign**:
        - **Positive**: Money coming in -- Examples: Income, Salary, Gifts, etc.
        - **Negative**: Money going out -- Examples: Expenses, Bills, Food, Car, Health, Technology, etc.
        - **Neutral**: Money moving between your locations/buckets or temporary transactions -- Examples: Transfers, Loans, etc.

        **About Neutral Transactions**: You can use them in 2 different purposes:
        1. Transfers between your own accounts or buckets. They don't affect your overall balance but change the distribution of money. For example, moving 500 from your ING account to Revolut account requires two transactions: one negative from ING and one positive to Revolut. Both transactions should use a neutral category to indicate this is just moving money around, not income or expense.
        2. Temporary transactions like loans. For example, if you borrow or lend money temporarily, these transactions won't affect your overall balance but show up on your reports.
        
        Categories help with reporting and understanding your spending patterns.
        
        üí° Tip for names: Add a prefix ("+" or üü¢), negative ("-" or üî¥) and neutral ("=" or ‚ö™) to differentiate between categories. It will help you find them easier when you add new transactions or filter them. You can also add prefixes to pair them with buckets/purposes (e.g. "-Necessities/Food", "-Necessities/Clothes","-Education/Books").
