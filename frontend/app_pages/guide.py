        **Locations** represent where your money is physically or virtually stored.

        - Examples: Cash, ING, Revolut, Savings account, Investment account
        - Each location tracks its own balance
        - You can transfer money between locations using neutral transactions (see more below).
        - Every transaction must have a location

        st.markdown("""
        **Buckets** represent different purposes or categories for your money.
        
        - Examples: Economies, Investments, Necessities, Education, Donation, Fun
        - Each bucket has an **Allocation Percentage** that determines how income is distributed
        - Total allocation percentages across all buckets should equal 100%
        - Buckets help you organize your money by purpose rather than location
        - Every transaction must have a bucket
        
        **Split Income Feature**: When your bucket allocations total 100%, you can use the "Split Income" option for positive transactions. This automatically creates multiple transactions that distribute your income according to your bucket allocation percentages. For example, if you receive 1000 and have buckets set up as Education (30%), Necessities (50%), and Fun (20%), the system will automatically create three separate transactions of 300, 500, and 200 to the respective buckets. Useful for automatically allocating your salary or other regular income.

    with st.expander("üîñ Categories", expanded=True):
        st.markdown("""
        **Categories** help classify your transactions by type. Each category has a **Sign**:
        - **Positive**: Money coming in -- Examples: Income, Salary, Gifts, etc.
        - **Negative**: Money going out -- Examples: Expenses, Bills, Food, Car, Health, Technology, etc.
        - **Neutral**: Money moving between your locations/buckets or temporary transactions -- Examples: Transfers, Loans, etc.

        **About Neutral Transactions**: You can use them in 2 different purposes:
        1. Transfers between your own accounts or buckets. They don't affect your overall balance but change the distribution of money. For example, moving 500 from your ING account to Revolut account requires two transactions: one negative from ING and one positive to Revolut. Both transactions should use a neutral category to indicate this is just moving money around, not income or expense.
        2. Temporary transactions like loans. For example, if you borrow or lend money temporarily, these transactions won't affect your overall balance but show up on your reports.
        
        Categories help with reporting and understanding your spending patterns.

        All neutral transactions require **two separate transactions**, one for the source and one for the destination.
        ### Transfers between Locations/Buckets
        
        ##### Step 1: Create the outgoing transaction
        1. Select the **Neutral** category you want to use
        2. Enter the amount as a **NEGATIVE NUMBER**
        3. Select the **source location/bucket** (where money is coming from)
        4. Save the transaction
        
        ##### Step 2: Create the incoming transaction
        1. Select the same **Neutral** category as above
        2. Enter the **same amount** as a **POSITIVE NUMBER**
        3. Select the **destination location/bucket** (where money is going to)
        4. If you're transferring between buckets, select the same location as the outgoing transaction. If you're transferring between locations, select the same bucket as the outgoing transaction.
        5. Save the transaction
        
        ### Loans/Temporary Transactions
        Create a special neutral category for these kind of transactions.
        ##### If you lend money to someone
        Enter **NEGATIVE AMOUNT** on outgoing transaction (when you give it) and **POSITIVE AMOUNT** on incoming transaction (when you receive them back).
        ##### If you borrow money from someone
        Enter **POSITIVE AMOUNT** on outgoing transaction (when you take it) and **NEGATIVE AMOUNT** on incoming transaction (when you pay them back).
